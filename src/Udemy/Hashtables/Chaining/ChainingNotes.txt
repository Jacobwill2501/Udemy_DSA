Common Strategies that handle collisions

1. Open Addressing - Linear Probing
does perform better on average, but chaining is easier to implement
...

2. Chaining

    - When we use chaining, instead of storing a value directly into an array
    each array position contains a linked-list so instead of storing employees you store a linked list.
    - This style does use more memory.

In chaining the time complexity in the worst case, every value would be collided into a linked list
so the worst case for chaining is O(n) linear time.

The key is a good hashing function to minimize collisions.
