Common Strategies that handle collisions

1. Open Addressing
    - if we try to put an employee in the table, and we find out there
    is something there already, we look for another position in the array
    - different ways to look for other positions, here we will use Linear Probing
    - Linear Probing: when we discover a position is in use or occupied, we increase the
                      hash value by 1 and check the resulting index
                      - done in a linear fashion time and every increment of the index is called a "probe" therefore, linear probing
