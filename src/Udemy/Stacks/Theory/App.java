/*
Notes for Stacks:
    - Conceptual/Abstract Data type
        - dictates the operations we can perform on a set of data, not how it is stored
        - can be backed by any data structure
    - LIFO - last in, first out
    - push - adds an item as the top item on the stack
    - pop - removes the top item on the stack
    - peek - gets the top item on the stack without popping it
    - ideal backing data structure: linked list
    - if memory is tight and maximum number of items is known: array is plausible
