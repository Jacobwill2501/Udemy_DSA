Trees
- Hierarchical data structure
- Each circle is a "node"
- each node can only have one parent
- have as many children as you want
- root is at the top
- Example: file system structure is a tree, each drive is a tree

From video bullets:
- Every item in the tree is a node
- The node at the top of the tree is the root
- Every non-root node has one and only one parent
- A node with no children is called a "leaf node"
- A singleton tree has only one node - the root


- The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf
- Leaf nodes have a height of 0
- The height of a tree is the height of its root node
- The deoth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node
